## Getting Started

Make sure you have the latest packages installed

```
npm install
```

Note: If you don't have `npm` installed, make sure you have
[node](http://nodejs.com) installed.

## Working with the scaffolded app

There's just enough in place to get you going. Go ahead
and make your changes to the code. You'll start your
javascript work in `app/server.js` by requiring your first
modules. Past that, well, the world is your oyster.

## Tests

All tests are written using `mocha` as a testing framework.
`chai` and `sinon` are available for assertions, spies and
other usefull testing stuff.

Tests are ran automatically when files under watch are modified.
You can also run the tests manually using `grunt test` which will
allow you to debug.
